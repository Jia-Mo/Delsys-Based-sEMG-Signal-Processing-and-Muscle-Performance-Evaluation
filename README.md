# Delsys-Based-sEMG-Signal-Processing-and-Muscle-Performance-Evaluation

Delsys Trigno Wireless System is a high-performing device to detect surface EMG signal, 
the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. According to surface EMG signal, 
we can evaluate muscle performance, like muscle force and muscle fatigue.
